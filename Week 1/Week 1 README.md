## Day 1: Intro into Cloud & AWS

- What is cloud computing?
     - Cloud computing is a technology that lets you access and use computing resources over the internet, like storage and processing power, without needing physical hardware. 
     - It provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, revolutionizing how individuals and businesses manage and deploy digital services.
     - For a more detailed explanation, please go to [cloud-more-info](Day1-resources/cloud-more-info.md)
- What is AWS?
     - AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a popular cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
     - A set of online services and tools that can be used to build and run applications without having to invest in physical servers.
     - For a more detailed explanation, please go to [AWS Basics](Day1-resources/aws-basics.md)

## Day 2: First Virtual Machine & Linux Intro

- [How to create a Virtual Machine on AWS?](Day2-resources.md/create-vm.md)
- [Useful LINUX Commands for beginners](Day2-resources.md/LINUXcommands.md)
- [Research into managing file ownership](Day2-resources.md/file-ownership.md)

## Day 3: Linux permissions, managing processes, environment variable, making/running scripts

- [Linux permissions](Day3-resources/Research_permissions)
    - Linux permissions dictate the level of access and control users, groups, and others have over files and directories. 
    - Each permission set includes read, write, and execute capabilities, enabling precise control over file interactions and executions.


- [Managing processes](Day3-resources/Processes.md)
    - Managing processes in Linux involves controlling the execution of programs, monitoring system resources, and prioritizing tasks. 
    - Linux provides commands and utilities to start, stop, and monitor processes, allowing users to efficiently allocate system resources and maintain system stability.

- [Environment variable](Day3-resources/Environment_Variables.md)
    - Environment variables in Linux are dynamic values that affect the behavior of processes and programs. 
    - They store configuration information, such as system paths and settings, influencing how applications operate and interact with the system environment.

- [Making/Running scripts](Day3-resources/Creating_RunningScript.md)
    - Creating and running scripts in Linux involves writing executable text files containing a series of commands or programming instructions. 

## Day 4 & Day 5
- [The process of deploying an app](<Day 5/process_of_deploying_app.md>)
