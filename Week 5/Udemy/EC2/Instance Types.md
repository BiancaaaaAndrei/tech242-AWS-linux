# Understanding EC2 Instance Types on AWS

## Types of EC2 Instances

AWS offers several instance types, each tailored to specific use cases. The main types are as follows:

1. **General Purpose Instances:**
   - Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
   - Suitable for diverse workloads (e.g., web servers, code repositories).
   - Example: T2 micro (Free Tier eligible).

2. **Compute Optimized Instances:**
   - Optimized for compute-intensive tasks.
   - Ideal for high-performance web servers, batch processing, HPC, machine learning, etc.
   - Example: C5 instances.

3. **Memory Optimized Instances:**
   - Fast performance for workloads processing large datasets in memory.
   - Suited for relational/non-relational databases, in-memory databases, BI, and real-time processing of unstructured data.
   - Example: R series, X1 high memory, Z1 instances.

4. **Storage Optimized Instances:**
   - Great for accessing large data sets on local storage.
   - Suitable for OLTP systems, relational/NoSQL databases, cache for in-memory databases, data warehousing, etc.
   - Example: I, G, or H1 instances.

## Instance Type Comparison

Let's compare instance types by looking at a few examples:

- T2.micro: 1 vCPU, 1 GB memory.
- R5.16xlarge: 16 vCPU, 512 GB memory (emphasis on memory).
- C5d.4xlarge: 16 vCPU, 32 GB memory (emphasis on CPU).
