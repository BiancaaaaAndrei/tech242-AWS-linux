# Docker Overview

- **Docker** is a software development platform designed to deploy applications by packaging them into containers. 
- **Containers are portable** and can run on any operating system, providing consistent behavior regardless of the environment. 
- Docker simplifies deployment, reduces compatibility issues, and makes it easier to maintain and scale applications.
- Applications are packaged into **Docker images**, which serve as the blueprint for containers.
- **Docker Repositories:** Docker images can be stored in repositories like Docker Hub or private repositories like Amazon ECR.
- **Lightweight:** Containers are more lightweight compared to virtual machines, as they don't package a full operating system.
