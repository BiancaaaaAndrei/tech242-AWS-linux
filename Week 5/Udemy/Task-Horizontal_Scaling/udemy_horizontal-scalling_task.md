# Horizontal scalling of EC2 Instances using Auto-Scaling Group with an Application Load Balancer

## Lab scenario
- In this lab, you will experience what its like to be a cloud architect working for an IT company. Recently, the company has seen cases of malfunctioning of EC2 instances and databases leading to service outage. You have been tasked with designing and implementing a resilient system that supports auto-recovery of EC2 instances and EBS from failures. The system must also support Multi-AZ deployment of RDS database instances for high availability and failover support. You will use CloudWatch and SNS for monitoring the EC2 instances as well as the RDS instances.

 ## Objectives
•	Provision RDS in Multi-AZ configuration for high availability and failover
•	Set up monitoring of EC2 instances and RDS databases
•	Configure auto-recovery of EC2 instance and EBS from failures
•	Create CloudWatch events to send SNS notifications
## Requirement
•	Comprehension of AWS terminology like EC2, RDS Multi-AZ, high-availability and database replication
•	Know the basics of IT. Windows / Linux / Mac OS X
## What is being learned
•	Resilient system architectures
•	High availability, failover for databases
•	Auto-recovery for EC2 instances
•	EC2, RDS Multi-AZ, CloudWatch, SNS
