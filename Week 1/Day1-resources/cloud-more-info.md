# Cloud Computing Overview

## Quick History/Timeline of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has evolved over the years, with its roots tracing back to the 1960s. However, the modern era of cloud computing began to take shape in the early 2000s. Key milestones include the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002 and the subsequent development of other major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

## What Can You Do with Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing offers a range of services, including scalable storage, processing power, databases, and more. Users can deploy and manage applications, store data, and access computing resources remotely.

## 4 Types/Models of Cloud

1. **Public Cloud:** Shared resources accessible over the internet.
2. **Private Cloud:** Resources exclusively for a single organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds.
4. **Multi-Cloud:** Use of services from multiple cloud providers.

## Different Types of Cloud Service

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Virtualized computing resources.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Tools and services for app development.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Ready-to-use software over the internet.

## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud (for Business)

### Advantages:
- Scalability
- Cost-Efficiency
- Accessibility

### Disadvantages:
- Security Concerns
- Dependency on Internet Connectivity

## OpEx vs CapEx

- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):** Pay-as-you-go model, operational costs.
- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** Upfront investment in physical infrastructure.

## Marketshare Breakdown
